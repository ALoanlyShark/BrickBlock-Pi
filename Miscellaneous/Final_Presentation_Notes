<Section 1>:
	-General summary of the project
		1. Usage of Blockly coding language to interface with BrickPi-enabled RaspberryPi brain to guide a robot through a maze.
<Section 2>:
	-Explain what BrickPi/RaspberryPi is
		1. RaspberryPi: Single-board single-core computer the size of a credit card
		2. BrickPi: Slide on board for the RaspberryPi that makes it compatible with Lego NXT/EV3 robotics parts
<Section 3>:
	-Explain what Blockly is
		1. Blockly: Google-developed graphical programming language based around using blocks to code
<Section 4>:
	-Hardware components of the project
		1. Two NXT motors that were synced up using P control
			A. Master motor (Port A)
				-Independent motor 
			B. Slave motor (Port D)
				-Motor that has its speed corrected to mirror the speed of the master motor
			C. P control
				-Control system where the correction in the speed of the slave motor is proportional to the size of the error 
		2. "Brain" of the robot
			A. RaspberryPi/BrickPi combination
		3. Wi-Fi dongle
			A. Allows for wireless communication between RaspberryPi/BrickPi and computer 
<Section 5>:
	-Software components of the project
		1. C
			A. libwebsockets
				a. C library that provides server and client APIs that allow for two way communication between robot and computer
			B. RobotC
				a. IDE aimed at students to allow programming and controllnig of NXT, VEX, RCX, and Arduino robots 
		2. HTML/CSS
			A. Used to code the website used to program and control the robot
		3. Javascript
			A. Provided framework for all the bricks used in the Blockly language and allowed us to create our own blocks
		4. Blockly
			A. Graphical computer language used as the main interactive feature of the project 
<Section 6>:
	-Application of BlockPi bot in real life
		1. Extremely simple to build and control
			A. Children can be introduced to coding early on
